## Reporting Issues

Before opening a new issue, please search the existing issues to see if it has already been reported.

- **Bug Reports**: If you find a bug, please use our **Bug Report template**. Be sure to include a minimal, reproducible PHP example that triggers the issue and state the expected vs. actual behavior.
- **Feature Requests**: If you have an idea for an enhancement or a new analysis rule, please use our **Feature Request template** to explain the use case and show target code snippets.

## Development Setup

Igor PHP is a hybrid tool: the static analysis engine is written in **Go**, and the Symfony configuration discovery/deep auditing is written in **PHP**.

### Prerequisites

You can develop and run tests either **natively** on your machine or inside **Docker** (recommended if you do not want to install Go or PHP locally).

#### Option A: Native Development (Best IDE support)
- **Go**: 1.18 or higher.
- **PHP**: 8.1 or higher (required for deep audit and reflection).
- **Composer**: To manage PHP dependencies.

#### Option B: Docker-based Development (Zero local dependencies)
- **Docker**: Installed and running.

### Local Setup
1. Fork the repository on GitHub and clone it locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/igor-php.git
   cd igor-php
   ```

*Note: The PHP bundle has no third-party vendor dependencies, so no `composer install` is necessary to develop or run the tool natively!*

## Project Architecture

Understanding where everything lives will help you make targeted changes:

- `cmd/igor/`: The entry point for the Go command-line tool.
- `internal/analyzer/`: The core static analysis parser and visitor logic. This is where AST traversing and leak detection rules are defined.
- `internal/auditor/`: Logic for invoking the PHP bridge and auditing services.
- `pkg/reporter/`: Formatter for reports (console, JSON, LLM-friendly review).
- `src/php/`: The Symfony Bundle (`IgorPhpBundle`) that compiles container definitions.
- `test/fixtures/`: PHP code fixtures used in integration and visitor tests.
- `examples/demo-leak/`: The "Igor Leak Lab", a Docker-based Symfony playground used to demonstrate state pollution and memory leaks in FrankenPHP.
- `examples/demo-leak-laravel/`: The Laravel twin of the Leak Lab, running on Laravel Octane with FrankenPHP workers.

## Testing & Quality Checks

We use a standard `Makefile` to simplify local development, testing, and linting.

### 1. Build the Binary
To compile the Go executable:
```bash
make build
```
This builds the `igor` binary under `bin/igor`.

### 2. Run Tests
We have a comprehensive test suite including Go unit tests, AST visitor tests, and integration tests using real PHP fixtures.
```bash
make test
```
*Note: Ensure PHP is available on your path as integration tests call PHP scripts to test reflection and bundle discovery.*

#### Example labs regression test
`TestLabsRegression` (`cmd/igor/labs_regression_test.go`) runs Igor on both example labs (`examples/demo-leak/` and `examples/demo-leak-laravel/`) and compares every finding with a reviewed snapshot in `cmd/igor/testdata/labs/<lab>.golden`. A change to the engine can no longer drop a detected leak, or add a new finding, without failing the test.

- The Symfony lab is audited through its real container: it needs PHP >= 8.4, `composer install` and `php bin/console cache:clear` in `examples/demo-leak/` (run `make install` there). Otherwise it is skipped, unless `IGOR_LABS_REQUIRED=1` is set, as in CI.
- When a change in the findings is **intended** (a new rule, a fixed false positive, a new lab experiment), regenerate the snapshots and review the diff in your pull request:
  ```bash
  make update-labs        # or: make docker-update-labs
  ```

### 3. Linting
We use `golangci-lint` to maintain Go code quality:
```bash
make lint
```

### 4. Full CI Validation
Before committing or pushing, run the entire local CI suite to ensure everything is correct:
```bash
make ci
```
This command runs `build`, `test`, and `lint` in sequence.

---

### Docker Alternative (Zero Local Dependencies)

If you choose **Option B (Docker)** during setup, you can build, test, and lint the codebase without having Go, PHP, or any other compilation tools installed on your host system:

* **Build the Docker Dev Image:**
  ```bash
  make docker-build
  ```
* **Run Tests inside Docker:**
  ```bash
  make docker-test
  ```
* **Run the Go Linter inside Docker:**
  ```bash
  make docker-lint
  ```
* **Run full CI validation inside Docker:**
  ```bash
  make docker-ci
  ```
* **Run the linter binary on a target path inside Docker:**
  ```bash
  make docker-run path=test/fixtures
  ```

*Note: The Docker environment mounts caching volumes (`igor-go-cache`, `igor-go-mod`, `igor-golangci-cache`) under the hood so subsequent container runs are extremely fast.*

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for clear and structured history.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

Common types:
- `feat`: A new analysis rule or CLI feature.
- `fix`: A bug fix (e.g. false positive resolution, parsing error fix).
- `docs`: Documentation updates.
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests.
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependencies updates.

Example:
```bash
feat(analyzer): detect local static variable assignment
fix(reporter): handle empty lines in CLI output formatting
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Create a descriptive branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-awesome-feature
   ```
2. Implement your changes and add corresponding tests:
   - Add a new PHP fixture under `test/fixtures/` and update the visitor or integration tests.
   - **If you are adding a new analysis rule**, ideally update our "Igor Leak Lab" laboratory under `examples/demo-leak/` (including services, the controller, and instructions) to demonstrate the issue in action.
3. Run `make ci` and fix any test failures or linter warnings.
4. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin HEAD
   ```
5. Open a Pull Request against the upstream repository.
6. Fill in the **Pull Request Template** with the required details.

Thank you again for helping make Igor PHP safer and faster! 🧟‍♂️⚡
